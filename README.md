### Brief Explanation
The project above displays an analysis of the sales, discounts, and profits within the US organized by state and region. The average sales, profit, and discount displayed on the top of the dashboard is per customer where each customer was randomly selected from across the country. The bar chart on the right half of the dashboard shows that profits from customers after the age of 90 are negative. Lastly, the chart on the bottom portion of the dashboard displays the average profits between 2012 and 2015 organized by each quarter.
